## Welcome to my Personal Project 

This repository contains my notebook 1 and 2 which goes in greater dephs to explain the concept of GNN models and its important usage using different datasets.

## Notebook 1
This Notebook 1 will go throught 4 different datasets showing the difference in using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and its layers applyed to it.


## Notebook 2
This Notebook will focus on the MovieLens dataset and with the purpose of creating a recommender system with pytorch using Graph Convelutional Networks (GCNs), attached will be a video explain the idea behind the project: https://youtu.be/bLHNjq_Sc28
